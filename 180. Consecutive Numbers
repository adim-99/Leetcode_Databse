select distinct a.Num as ConsecutiveNums 
from Logs as a, Logs as b, Logs as c 
where c.Id=b.Id-1 
and b.Id=a.Id-1 
and a.Num=b.Num 
and b.Num=c.Num

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create multiple tables where value of each row equates to the value of the row_no - 1. Do this again for 3 consec numbers. Ensure IDs all match as well
