select a.Score as score, count(b.score) as `Rank` 
from Scores as a, (select distinct score from Scores) as b
where b.Score >= a.Score
group by a.Id 
order by a.score desc

1. Create a 2nd table with just the distinct scores
2. Equate each row with the 2nd table, filtering rows where the scores from the 2nd table that are more than the score values from the initial table
3. Since a count(*) column is being created for the 2nd table, the group by function will reveal how many rows (scores) were not removed to satisfy the where condition
4. group by id is sufficient however, 'group by id, score' also works
5. Order by score from the first table, descending from top score down, with rank on its side
